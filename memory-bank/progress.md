# Progress: Apex Coder

**Overall Status:** Foundational structure complete. **Pivoted from Genkit to Vercel AI SDK.** Webview loading issue resolved.

**Completed Milestones:**
- Initial requirements gathering and planning.
- Definition of MVP scope.
- High-level architecture design.
- Creation of initial Memory Bank files.
- VSCode Extension scaffolding created.
- Vue.js WebView UI scaffolding created.
- Basic WebView <-> Extension communication implemented and tested.
- Project structure moved to root directory.
- Decision to use Vercel AI SDK instead of Genkit.
- Resolved Webview resource loading (`net::ERR_ACCESS_DENIED`) issue.

**Current Phase:** Testing Vercel AI SDK Integration.

**What Works:**
- Basic Extension structure.
- Basic WebView UI.
- Communication link between WebView and Extension Host.
- Webview UI loads correctly.

**What's Left (High Level):**
- **Fix Completed:** Resolved command registration issues (`command not found` error). User confirmed fix.
- **Implemented:** Added functional logic to `apex-coder.setApiKey` command.
- **Implemented:** Updated `getWebviewContent` in `extension.ts` to load the built Vue.js frontend into the Webview panel.
- **Refactored:** Modified `extension.ts` message handling to support Webview-driven configuration (`configStatus`, `saveConfiguration`). Removed auto-init on activation.
- **Fix:** Resolved Webview `net::ERR_ACCESS_DENIED` by correcting asset path regex in `getWebviewContent` and ensuring full VS Code restart. <!-- Updated Fix -->
- **Implemented (Frontend):** Modified `App.vue` to handle Webview-driven setup flow (conditional rendering, setup form, message handling).
- **Implemented (Frontend):** Changed Provider/Model inputs to dropdowns in `App.vue` setup form.
- **Refactored:** Added development mode flag (`IS_DEVELOPMENT`) in `extension.ts` to enable loading Webview from Vite dev server for hot-reloading.
- **Configured:** Added compound launch configuration to `.vscode/launch.json` for easier development workflow.
- **Configured:** Enabled CORS in Vite dev server config (`webview-ui/vite.config.ts`).
- **Ready for Testing:** Test Vercel AI SDK integration via the complete Webview setup and chat flow. <!-- Updated Status -->
- Refine secure API key handling (e.g., prompt user on activation if key missing).
- Implement further core AI features (tool use, object generation, etc.).
- Add support for more Vercel AI SDK providers in `configLoader.ts`.
- Testing, optimization, packaging.

**Known Issues/Blockers:**
- Activation fails in Cursor environment (use standard VS Code for development/debugging).
