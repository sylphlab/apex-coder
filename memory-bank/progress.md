# Progress: Apex Coder

**Overall Status:** Foundational structure complete. **Pivoted from Genkit to Vercel AI SDK.**

**Completed Milestones:**
- Initial requirements gathering and planning.
- Definition of MVP scope.
- High-level architecture design.
- Creation of initial Memory Bank files.
- VSCode Extension scaffolding created.
- Vue.js WebView UI scaffolding created.
- Basic WebView <-> Extension communication implemented and tested.
- Project structure moved to root directory.
- Decision to use Vercel AI SDK instead of Genkit.

**Current Phase:** Refactoring for Vercel AI SDK.

**What Works:**
- Basic Extension structure.
- Basic WebView UI.
- Communication link between WebView and Extension Host.

**What's Left (High Level):**\n- Test Vercel AI SDK integration (Status check, basic chat/streaming).\n- Refine secure API key handling (e.g., prompt user on activation if key missing).\n- Implement further core AI features (tool use, object generation, etc.).\n- Add support for more Vercel AI SDK providers in `configLoader.ts`.\n- Testing, optimization, packaging.

**Known Issues/Blockers:**
- None currently (post-pivot).
