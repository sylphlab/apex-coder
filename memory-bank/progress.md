# Progress: Apex Coder

**Overall Status:** Foundational structure complete. Vercel AI SDK integrated. UI refactored to use UnoCSS. Auto-panel display implemented. **UnoCSS styling issues resolved.** Webview-driven setup flow implemented. **Fixed development workflow and UI issues.** **Provider-first architecture implemented.**

**Completed Milestones:**

- Initial requirements gathering and planning.
- Definition of MVP scope.
- High-level architecture design.
- Creation of initial Memory Bank files.
- VSCode Extension scaffolding created.
- Vue.js WebView UI scaffolding created.
- Basic WebView <-> Extension communication implemented and tested.
- Project structure moved to root directory.
- Decision to use Vercel AI SDK instead of Genkit.
- Resolved Webview resource loading (`net::ERR_ACCESS_DENIED`) issue.
- Resolved command registration issues (`command not found` error).
- Resolved configuration registration issue (`CodeExpectedError`).
- **Switched UI styling to UnoCSS:**
  - Installed dependencies (including `@unocss/reset`).
  - Configured UnoCSS (`uno.config.ts`).
  - Integrated with Vite and Vue (`vite.config.ts`, `main.ts`).
  - Removed old CSS files.
  - Rewrote `App.vue` template with UnoCSS utilities.
  - Fixed import errors in `main.ts`.
- **Implemented Auto-Panel Display:**
  - Added `onStartupFinished` activation event.
  - Added logic to execute `showPanel` command in `activate` function.
- **Fixed UnoCSS Styling:** Styles now render correctly in both browser and WebView. (Root cause likely related to CSP/reset/config interactions, resolved through previous steps).
- **UI Overhaul Progress:**
  - Applied initial style adjustments (padding, title size) to `webview-ui/src/App.vue`.
  - Applied Nordic-inspired styles to `webview-ui/src/views/SetupView.vue`.
  - Applied Nordic-inspired styles to `webview-ui/src/views/ChatView.vue`.
  - **Fix:** Corrected Vue template syntax errors in `ChatView.vue` caused by `apply_diff` comments.
- **Provider-First Architecture Implemented:**
  - Created base provider interface (`BaseAIProvider`) and implementation classes for each provider.
  - Implemented provider-specific files for Google AI, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, Mistral, Azure, Cohere, and DeepSeek.
  - Updated `configLoader.ts` to use the new provider architecture.
  - Modified `AiConfig` interface to use a credentials object for provider-specific settings.
  - Updated related files (`extension.ts`, `panelManager.ts`, tests) to work with the new architecture.

**Current Phase:** **Provider Architecture** - Completed provider-first design with separate files for each provider.

**What Works:**

- Basic Extension structure.
- Basic WebView UI (styled with UnoCSS, working correctly).
- Communication link between WebView and Extension Host.
- Webview UI loads correctly.
- Commands are registered correctly.
- Configuration settings are registered correctly.
- UnoCSS is integrated.
- Extension activates on startup and attempts to show panel.
- Provider-first architecture with modular design.
- WebView UI configuration state managed by Pinia (`configStore.ts`).

**What's Left (High Level):**

- **Implemented:** Added functional logic to `apex-coder.setApiKey` command.
- **Implemented:** Updated `getWebviewContent` in `extension.ts` to load the built Vue.js frontend into the Webview panel.
- **Refactored:** Modified `extension.ts` message handling to support Webview-driven configuration (`configStatus`, `saveConfiguration`). Removed auto-init on activation.
- **Fix:** Resolved Webview `net::ERR_ACCESS_DENIED` by correcting asset path regex in `getWebviewContent` and ensuring full VS Code restart. <!-- Updated Fix -->
- **Implemented (Frontend):** Modified `App.vue` to handle Webview-driven setup flow (conditional rendering, setup form, message handling).
- **Implemented (Frontend):** Changed Provider/Model inputs to dropdowns in `App.vue` setup form.
- **Refactored:** Added development mode flag (`IS_DEVELOPMENT`) in `extension.ts` to enable loading Webview from Vite dev server for hot-reloading.
- **Configured:** Added compound launch configuration to `.vscode/launch.json` for easier development workflow.
- **Configured:** Enabled CORS in Vite dev server config (`webview-ui/vite.config.ts`).
- **Fix:** Resolved `CodeExpectedError` by registering AI configuration settings in `package.json`.
- **UI Refactor:** Converted UI styling to use UnoCSS and fixed related issues.
- **Auto-Display:** Implemented automatic panel display on startup.
- **Fixed:** UnoCSS styles restored in browser and WebView.
- **Committed:** Committed UI styling changes (Commit `6707987`).
- **Refined Theme Integration:** Adjusted theme variable usage in `ChatView.vue` for better consistency.
- **Committed:** Committed theme integration refinements (Commit `a343f92`).
- **Simplified Development Workflow:**
  - Removed unnecessary `dev.js` script.
  - Updated tasks to use watch mode for better development experience.
  - Updated launch configurations for streamlined debugging.
  - Updated README.md with clear development instructions.
- **Fixed Development Workflow:**
  - Fixed hot reload functionality by setting `IS_DEVELOPMENT = false` in `contentProvider.ts`
  - Suppressed annoying "API Key for provider 'deepseek' not found in secrets" warning
  - Fixed welcome page black screen issue
- **Implemented Provider-First Architecture:**
  - Created base provider interface and abstract class
  - Implemented provider-specific files for 8 different providers
  - Updated configuration handling to use provider-specific credentials.
  - Modified related files to work with the new architecture.
- **Refactored WebView UI State Management:**
  - Installed Pinia.
  - Created `configStore.ts` to manage configuration state.
  - Refactored `App.vue`, `SetupView.vue`, and `ChatView.vue` to use the Pinia store, removing props/emits for config state.
  - Fixed duplicate attribute error in `ChatView.vue` after refactoring.
- **Completed:** Refined secure API key handling: Added a warning message with a 'Set API Key' action button on activation if a required key is missing (`src/extension.ts`).
- **Next Task:** Implement further core AI features (tool use, object generation, etc.).
- Implement further core AI features (tool use, object generation, etc.).
- Testing, optimization, packaging.

**Known Issues/Blockers:**

- Activation fails in Cursor environment (use standard VS Code for development/debugging).
