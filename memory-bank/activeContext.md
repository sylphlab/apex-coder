## User Task
"修理好所有問題，然後繼續進度" (Fix all problems and continue progress)

## Session Continuation Instructions
1. ✅ Read all Memory Bank files
2. ✅ Analyze open files and tabs for issues
3. ✅ Fix identified problems in rag-service.ts
4. Update Memory Bank files to reflect changes
5. Continue with normal development progress
6. Next task: Implement further core AI features (tool use, object generation, etc.) as mentioned in progress.md

## Current Focus
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) service implementation
- Ensuring all code follows TypeScript best practices and guidelines
- Preparing for implementing further core AI features
